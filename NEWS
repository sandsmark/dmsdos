The project is long time abandoned but it can be still usable to rescue
data from old STACKER and DOUBLESPACE volumes.

The version dmsdos-0.9.2.3-pre2-alt2 is based on patches found at

http://packages.altlinux.org/en/Sisyphus/srpms/dmsdos/get

 2012-06-07 Fr. Br. George <george at altlinux.ru> 0.9.2.3-alt2
    - Fix gcc4.6 build

 2012-03-25 Fr. Br. George <george at altlinux.ru> 0.9.2.3-alt1
    - Initial build

The modified version disables kernel code build which allows
to build userspace tools for volume dump.

New in this release (since dmsdos 0.9.2.1):

* THIS RELEASE IS EXPERIMENTAL AND ITS USAGE WITH 2.3.x
  is DANGEROUS.

* Experimental WIP to support 2.3.x kernels. It is DANGEROUS, because
  mmap support is missing for 2.3.x. Basic functionality for 2.3.30
  was obtained.
  Found bug and provided patch to solve write after end of file or dir
  cluster allocations fails in newer 2.2.x kernels (2.2.13 tested).

New in this release (since dmsdos 0.9.2.0):

* Small changes for dmsdos to compile under 2.2.x kernels. WARNING: A serious
  bug in the vfat filesystem can hang the system when using dmsdos under 
  Linux kernel version 2.2.0, 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. This bug is triggered by
  dmsdos. At the time of writing, 2.2.3 has not been released yet. 
  See file INSTALL.TXT how to fix this bug.
