This is the README for the DMSDOS CVF-FAT filesystem extensions. 

CVF-FAT is a generic modular Compressed Volume Files interface for the FAT 
filesystems.

DMSDOS is a module which provides similar functionality to the former dmsdos 
filesystem: support for Microsoft's doublespace/drivespace and for Stac's 
stacker. DMSDOS uses the CVF-FAT extensions and can be considered as a
sample implementation for using the CVF-FAT extensions. 

CVF-FAT is the official successor of the dmsdos filesystem. DMSDOS itself
is still continued, but it now is a child of CVF-FAT and not a filesystem
any more.
