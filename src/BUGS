Known bugs:
-----------

- In some 2.1.XX kernels umsdos support is broken. Get at least 2.1.94
  if you want to use umsdos-style long filenames in CVFs. For 2.0.xx
  kernels everything is okay.

- Advanced memory allocation (XMALLOC) may crash a 2.1.xx system.
  I once got a report of a serious crash with old dmsdosfs. The code
  for XMALLOC has never been changed, but the kernel keeps changing...
  It is known to work without problems under 2.0.33.

- Writable mmap support must be turned *on* for some 2.1.xx kernels.
  The code fails to compile if it is switched off, so you'll see it quite
  early :)
