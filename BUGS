Known bugs:
-----------

- Support for 2.3.XX is broken now. It is uder development and is targeted
  to 2.3.30 and higher. MMAP support for 2.3.XX is missing and MMAP will
  lead to Oops.

- In some 2.1.XX kernels umsdos support is broken. Get at least 2.1.94
  if you want to use umsdos-style long filenames in CVFs. For 2.0.xx
  and 2.2.x kernels everything is okay.

- Advanced memory allocation (XMALLOC) may crash a 2.1.xx/2.2.xx system.
  I once got a report of a serious crash with old dmsdosfs. The code
  for XMALLOC has never been changed, but the kernel keeps changing...
  It is known to work without problems under 2.0.xx.

- Writable mmap support must be turned *on* for newer 2.1.xx and all 2.2.xx
  kernels. The code fails to compile if it is switched off, so you'll see it 
  quite early :)

- Mounting with the cvf_format=xxx mount option may succeed even if the
  specified format xxx is not present. The CVF-FAT interface does auto-
  detection if an invalid format is specified. This was meant as a feature
  but seems to cause confusion. In rare cases it may lead to a CVF accessed
  by the plain FAT driver (which does not complain on mount but it will
  scream loudly when, for example, a 'ls' is done on the mount point).
  This bug is fixed by updating the file cvf.c as described in INSTALL.TXT.


Kernel bugs related to using dmsdos
-----------------------------------

- vfat brelse bug  
  Priority: Serious.
  Affected kernels: 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, probably late 2.1.xx.
  Fixed since: --not yet fixed, hopefully fixed in 2.2.3 or 2.2.4--
  Symptom: Kernel panics with "VFS: LRU list corrupted" and hangs.
  Fix: See file patches/DIFFS.TXT for a patch.

- fat truncate bug
  Priority: Minor.
  Affected kernels: all 2.0.xx, all 2.1.xx, 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2.
  Fixed since: --not yet fixed, hopefully fixed in 2.2.3 or 2.2.4--
  Symptom: Kernel can write to read-only mounted CVF and corrupt the FAT.
           Happens very rarely and requires a slightly damaged filesystem
           to provoke this bug.
  Fix: See file patches/DIFFS.TXT for a patch.

- msdos rmdir bug
  Priority: Minor.
  Affected kernels: 2.0.34, 2.0.35, FAT32-patched 2.0.33 or earlier,
                    some 2.1.xx (unknown which ones)
  Fixed since: 2.0.36, unknown for 2.1.xx
  Symptom: Removing non-empty directories succeeds but leaves lost cluster
           chains behind.
  Fix: See file patches/DIFFS.TXT for a patch.

- fat add cluster / fat extend dir for 2.3.xx
  Priority: Serious.
  Affected kernels: 2.2.?-2.2.13+, 2.3.?-2.3.30+
  Fixed since: --not yet fixed, hopefully fixed in 2.2.15 and 2.3.31--
  Symptom: File or directory (only dir for 2.3.x) cannot be enlargered.
  Fix: See file patches/DIFFS.TXT for a patch.

- fat read super
  Priority: Serious.
  Affected kernels: 2.3.?-2.3.30+
  Fixed since: --not yet fixed, hopefully fixed in 2.3.31--
  Symptom: Oops during CVF mount phase.
  Fix: See file patches/DIFFS.TXT for a patch.
